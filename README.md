# Servo motor setup algorithm
To create an electronic circuit to operate a servo motor
we need to
- Arduino board
- wires
- servo motor
- and a potentiometer
  We connect the motor to the Arduino, as well as the potentiometer, which in turn will control the direction of the servo
Then we download the code to run it
